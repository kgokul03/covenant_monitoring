As used in this Agreement, the following terms\\nhave the meanings specified below:\\n“ABR”, when used in reference to any Loan or Borrowing, refers to such Loan, or\\nthe Loans comprising such Borrowing, bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to\\nthe Alternate Base Rate.\\n“Acquired Product” means any Product and/or related Intellectual\\nProperty acquired or licensed by a Loan Party or any Subsidiary from a Third Party to\\nfacilitate the advertisement, development, importing, manufacturing, marketing, offering\\nfor sale, promotion, sale, testing, use or distribution of such Product by a Loan Party or a\\nSubsidiary.\\n“Acquisition” means the purchase, inbound license or other acquisition, or option\\nto purchase, license or otherwise acquire, whether through a single transaction or a series\\nof related transactions, of (a) a majority of the Equity Interests, whether by purchase of\\nsuch Equity Interests or upon the exercise of an option or warrant for, or conversion of\\nsecurities into, such Equity Interests, of another Person, (b) assets of another Person which\\nconstitute all or substantially all of the assets of such Person or of a division, line of\\nbusiness or other business unit of such Person, or (c) assets consisting of an Acquired\\nProduct, royalty rights or similar assets of such Person.\\n“Acquisition Consideration” means the sum of the cash purchase price for any\\nPermitted Acquisition payable in respect of such Permitted Acquisition (and which, for the\\navoidance of doubt, but subject to the proviso in this definition, shall include purchase\\nprice adjustment, royalty, earnout, contingent payment, progress payments, milestone\\npayments or other deferred payment of a similar nature) plus the aggregate amount of\\nIndebtedness (of the type that are described in clauses (a) through (g) and (l) of the\\ndefinition of “Indebtedness”) assumed on such date in connection with such Permitted\\nAcquisition;

To the extent\\nthat the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap\\nAgreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support “QFC Credit\\nSupport” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as\\nfollows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\\nunder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\\nand Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the\\n“U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit\\nSupport (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents\\nand any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of\\nNew York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):\\nIn the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered\\nParty”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the\\ntransfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any\\ninterest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and\\nany rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from\\nsuch Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective\\nunder the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit\\nSupport (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the\\nlaws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a\\nBHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S.\\nSpecial Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might\\notherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised\\nagainst such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such\\nDefault Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the\\nSupported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States\\nor a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and\\nagreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in\\nno event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any\\nQFC Credit Support.\\nSection 9.20 Marketing Consent.
